# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Instruction of set up this app

## Check node, npm and yarn versions

1. Open your command prompt
2. Run the command `node -v` and `npm -v` for checking node and npm version
3. Run the command `yarn -v`

## Install Node

(If node is already installed in you pc then no need to follow the step)

1. Got to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download latest node installer and install install it
3. Check again the node and npm versions.

## Install yarn your pc

(If you already have yarn in your pc then no need to follow the step)

1. You have to install node first and then you can install yarn
2. Run the command `npm install --global yarn`
3. Check yarn version

## Clone and install the necessary packages

1. Create a folder in you computer. Which will be used as the root folder of the project. (N.B.- The folder must be empty)
2. Run the command `git clone -b <branch-name> https://github.com/HabibullahFTL/react-app-boilerplate.git .`
3. Now for installing dependencies, run the command `yarn`
4. For opening your application to browser, `yarn start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
